[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/uktrade/four-key-metrics/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/uktrade/four-key-metrics/tree/main)

Intended as a way to measure the `four key metrics` as defined in the book Accelerate by Forsgren, Humble and Kim.

- [X] [product delivery] lead time (Time between code committed and code deployed)
- [ ] deployment frequency (Number of deployments of new code per day)
- [ ] mean time to restore (MTTR) (How long does it take to restore the service after it has been impaired?)
- [ ] change fail percentage (% of times the CI/CD pipeline for the default branch fails or causes an outage in any environment)
